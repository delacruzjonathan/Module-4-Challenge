# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This week's Challenge required a coding assesment that is to include multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges such as a score generator and username log. I have made attempts to research and create an interactive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rendering that led to the webpage entitled "Pop Quiz."


## Installation
1. Created an HTML page that would facilitate question to question as well as created a div to begin the pop quiz.
2. Added hover and other features (color and size adjustments on divs) to the CSS to style the quiz.
3. Worked in JavaScript to create a score generator as well as a timer that moves from question to question.
4. User name input has not been place and the challenge is still in progress. I will resubmit to make alterations and add missing features (timer needs adjustment as well).

## Screenshot

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
